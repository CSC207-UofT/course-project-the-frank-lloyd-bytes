**Scenario Walkthrough:**
Student Ming opens the Tcard App, and the TCardAppShell creates instances of what is needed to run the app. The Menu class asks for her to input the username and password. Once she inputs them, the Controller will run the login with the inputted information and print a message that corresponds to whether the user has inputted a username that doesn’t exist in the UserList, a password that doesn’t match her password, or whether the login was successful (the username exist in the list and the password matches the username). The Controller will be deciding on which message to output by checking the login UCheckResult UserCommand class gives. UserComman will get this UCheckResult by checking the user input with the user info that’s stored in the UserList.
Once Student Ming successfully logs in, she is presented with a user profile which is printed by the Controller. This user profile information is stored in the Student class (which is a subclass of the User class). It has the student’s legal name, utorid, password, status (whether it’s a student or faculty member), id number, email, years in UofT, and which faculty they belong to. The user profile is called by the username Ming entered when logging in. If Ming was to become a professor at UofT in the future, she would instead be stored as a faculty instance. She would log in with her faculty username and password and see her profile and information as a faculty member.
