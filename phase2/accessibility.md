Accesibility Report

Equitable Use
- Our app currently doesn’t have it but we tried to implement a multi language option at some point. This would make the app more equitable to use as not everyone who studies at UofT is comfortable with English (especially the student’s who are in the English Language Learning program).

Flexibility
- The app currently has a dark-light view mode that the user’s can switch between depending on which option they want and need at that moment.
- In the future, having not just an Android version of the app but an IOS as well would make the app more flexible as it can be used in a variety of platforms

Simple and Intuitive Use
- The app currently has toasters that provide effective prompting and feedback in tasks like logging in, registering, or changing password. For example, when the user is trying to change their password, the new password matches the old password, the user will be warned about it with the “New password the same as the old password” message. When the user fills all the fields for changing password correctly, there will be a “Password changed successfully” message.

Perceptible Information
- We have put a card view into the dashboard that changes text and color depending on the UCheck results. Through this, the users can easily perceive their UCheck results once they login. The large font of the text for the “UCheck Failed” or “UCheck Passed” also makes the information more easy to perceive.

Tolerance of Error
- This feature isn’t very applicable because the app usage doesn’t have any risky consequences. However, if going to the campus without completing the UCheck would count as an error (since it’s a Covid self assessment, and you shouldn’t be at campus if you fail the assessment), in the future the app can pop up a notification reminding the user to complete their UCheck test when the user enters the campus grounds. For this, the user needs to give location access to the app.

Low Physical Effort
- If the user is using the app in a dark environment, having the dark mode options reduces the contrast between the screen and the environment which makes it less taxing on the eyes to look at the screen.
- Having the critical user information (status of the user, their department, which year they are in) + UCheck results in the QR code makes the process to enter the facilities faster as the user won’t have to pull out each information separately. Less waiting time in the Robarts line.

Size and Space for Approach and Use
- This feature isn’t very applicable to our app as the feature is mostly important for hardware design and the app is a software. The only thing that can be mentioned is that the QR code color (black) highly contrasts the background (white), which makes it easy to scan from different positions and distances.


Our app would be marketable towards UofT facilities and student + facilities. The reasoning for that is we designed the app thinking about the difficulties we face as UofT students. Having a virtual TCard would make our lives easier when we forget our TCards at home or lose it and have to wait for a long time to get a new one. Offline feature of the UCheck is also really helpful for UofT students as most students remember to complete the test when they’re entering a UofT library and the internet can be really unstable. It takes a really long time to connect to the uCheck website with the phone sometimes, an offline version of the test that’s easily accessible will be very convenient for students. As for the UofT facilities, they need to check each student’s TCard and UCheck results, which can result in really long lines when the student’s have difficulty connecting to UCheck website or Acorn (when you don’t have a physical TCard). Long lines are especially problematic in Covid days as it means a lot of people are crowded in a small area. With this app, the entry to the buildings will take much less time and there won’t be a line as long as the ones we see currently. In the future, with some modification, the app could also be marketable for other universities that use a card system to enter buildings and require self covid assessments.


Currently, the program isn’t marketable to IOS users as it’s designed for Android. It’s also not marketable towards visually impaired students as all the outputs in the app are all visuals. Having the option for users to fill in the required text boxes with voice commands and having a voice reader to direct their usage of the app can solve this problem in the future.
