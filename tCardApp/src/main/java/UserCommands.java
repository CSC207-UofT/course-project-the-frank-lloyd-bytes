/**
 * This is a user case layer class which allows the menu to access User datatype.
 * This class is a collection of commands which give the functionality  to the menu class
 * but also organizes user entities and allows overall user engagement via polymorphic methods.
 * Key services are checking access to groups, discounts, departments and future extendable permissions.
 *
 * For the first iteration we will simply have commands to check if user already exists, and check password.
